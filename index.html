    <div class="accordion" id="about">
      <p>Airbnb was born in 2007 when two hosts welcomed three guests to their San Francisco home, and has since grown to over 5 million hosts who have welcomed over 2 billion guest arrivals in almost every country across the globe. Every day, hosts offer unique stays and experiences that make it possible for guests to connect with communities in a more authentic way.</p>

They champion a winning strategy and leverage metrics to ensure we are making progress against it. They partner with talented cross-functional team members (across product marketing, engineering, design, analytics, etc.) and lead teams to execute upon a shared vision. We are looking for leaders who want to join us in this journey to accomplish our mission of creating belonging everywhere.</p>
