<!-- ─── ABOUT AIRBNB ─────────────────────────────────── -->
<div class="content-frame">
  <h2>📘 About Airbnb</h2>
  <p>Airbnb was born out of a simple yet revolutionary idea in 2007, when two designers, Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia, opened their San Francisco apartment to three guests in need of a place to stay during a sold-out design conference. This humble beginning sparked a global movement, combining exceptional design thinking with the power of community. Today, Airbnb stands as a beacon of innovation and creativity, with over five million hosts welcoming more than one billion guests around the world.</p>

  <p>At its core, Airbnb re-defines the way people connect and explore the world, blending functionality and aesthetics to create extraordinary travel experiences. For design-focused product managers, Airbnb represents a unique opportunity to shape the future of human-centred design at scale. Our platform is a living canvas, where every pixel, interaction and feature is thoughtfully crafted to delight users, empower hosts and build trust within a global network of travellers.</p>

  <p>Airbnb's DNA is rooted in design excellence—from the intuitive simplicity of our booking flow to the personalised experiences powered by cutting-edge AI. As a design-focused product manager, you’ll collaborate with world-class designers, engineers and researchers to push boundaries and solve complex problems with elegance and empathy. Together, we’ll craft seamless user journeys that inspire exploration, foster belonging and elevate the role of design in shaping human connections.</p>

  <p>If you’re passionate about combining data-driven insights with creative vision, and you’re ready to lead the charge in designing the future of travel and hospitality, Airbnb is your stage.

Our Trust & Safety team—engineers, data scientists, designers, product managers, and operations specialists—builds machine learning models to detect risk, deter risky actors, and support investigators worldwide. We set community standards, defend against bots and fraud, and ensure every user interaction upholds our high bar for safety and belonging.</p>

  <p>We build our products and systems from a first-principles basis—breaking down complex challenges to their most fundamental truths and rebuilding innovative solutions from the ground up. This approach ensures we are not constrained by precedent, but guided by creativity, clear reasoning, and the pursuit of the best outcomes for our community.</p>
